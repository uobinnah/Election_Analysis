ELECTION-AUDIT SUMMARY

This script could easily be used to examine any large or small voter elections with only slight variations to the code. One possible use could be examining the elcetion based off of party instead of county. To do this you would only need to change the code to say "party" where it says "county" as well as a csv file with a party column instead of a county column. You could also use this code to determine the results of an election with a yes or no ballot issue. You would just need to change the counties to Yes or 
No and change the code to the same.
